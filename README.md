# Movie_Recommmendation_Engage
## About App
This is a movie recommendation system which recommend you movies on three categories:
- [x] Trending Movies
- [x] Content-Based Recommender
- [x] User-Based Recommender
## Work Flow and Algorithms used in each recommender:

### Trending Movies:
> This recommender is simply giving movies sorted on the basis of weighted rating that have been calculated by using vote counts and average votes given to a particular movie.

### Content-Based Recommender:
> This recommender computes similarity between movies based on certain metrics and suggests movies that are most similar to a particular movie. I build content based-recommender based on movieâ€™s cast, crew, genres and keywords.  I plan on doing is creating a metadata dump for every movie which consists of genres, director, main actors and keywords. I then use a Count Vectorizer to create our count matrix. We now have a pairwise cosine similarity matrix for all the movies in our dataset. We can directly show top similar via using cosine similarity matrix but to improve this recommendation I have also added a mechanism to remove bad movies and return movies which are popular and have had a good critical response.
<br> In the app it will ask you for a movie title and recommend you movies that are similar to the given movie.

### User-Based Recommender:
> In user based recommendation I have used collabrative filtering. Collaborative Filtering is based on the idea that users similar to a me can be used to predict how much I will like a particular product or service those users have used/experienced but I have not.I have used the Surprise library that used extremely powerful algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to minimise RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and give great recommendations.
<br>The Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD  is a matrix decomposition method for reducing a matrix to its constituent parts in order to make certain subsequent matrix calculations simpler.<br>In the app it will ask you a user id and movie title and then recommend movies on the basis of user taste (whose id is given) and similar to the given movie.

<br>  As you can see for same movie title "The Fighter" It is showing different results because of different user ids.
